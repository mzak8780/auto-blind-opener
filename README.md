# auto-blind-opener
This project consists of the planning, design, build and testing of an automatic blind opener. 

The design is an adaptation of the following project: https://www.the-diy-life.com/arduino-automatic-blind-opener-works-with-a-remote-control-alexa/.

Customisations were applied to fit the requirements of my particular blinds and window layout.

The blind opener is voice controlled via the use of a universal RF hub and an Alexa puck.
